Installing Tobii EyeX Libraries


First create the project that you would like to use the library in.

Find the "references" folder and right click.

Select add reference

Browse and find this folder and select "tobii.EyeX.Client.Net20.dll" and "EyeXFramework.dll"

Now add the "Tobii.EyeX.Client.dll" to the project by draging it to the project folder.

Finally select "Tobii.EyeX.Client.dll" you just added to the project and change the property "copy to output directory" to either "copy if newer" or "copy always"


If you are still unable to access the library watch this video to see step by step how it is added https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w13JQW41D54. 
Ignore the part about editing the dll for a earlier version of .net
