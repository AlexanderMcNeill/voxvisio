# voxviso
Vox Visio is an assistive technology research project that has developed and proven an integrated eye gaze and voice control system. The system has been used for formal experiments into computer control and the application will form the basis for a open source repository for assistive technology.

Note: This statement is using back casting and may be changed to match what we have actually achieved

Vox Visio was written as part of Daniel Mazur and Alex McNeill's undergraduate project. The project allows a user to fully control a computer through the use of their voice and eyes. The idea behind the project was to create an affordable software that can be used for research and by people who need it. The project is completely open source and free.
