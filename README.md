# Vox Visio
Vox Visio is an assistive technology research project that has developed and proven the effectiveness of an integrated eye gaze and voice control system. The system has been used for formal experiments into computer control and the application will form the basis for a open source repository for assistive technology.

Vox Visio was written as part of Daniel Mazur and Alex McNeill's undergraduate project. The project allows a user to fully control a computer through the use of their voice and eyes. The idea behind the project was to create an affordable software that can be used for research and by people who need it. The project is completely open source and free.

#Getting Started

See the installation section of the [wiki](https://github.com/AlexanderMcNeill/voxvisio/wiki/) to get started. It will take you step by step how to install and setup the software.

#Supported Platforms

Vox Visio targets the .NET 4.5 framework and uses the Tobii EyeX SDK. This means it will run on systems Windows 7 onward and was designed to run on Windows 7.

The system will work on Windows 8 and Windows 10 but we are unsure how it will interact with the metro and virtual desktops.

#Necessary Hardware 

To use the software you will need the following hardware:
* [Tobii EyeX Gaze Tracker](http://www.tobii.com/xperience/)
* A microphone. For testing we used the SpeechWare USB 3-in-1 TableMike

#Optional Software

To add functionality and improve parts of our system you have to option of using some external software. The software we support is:

* [Dragon Naturally Speaking](http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-pc/index.htm)
* [Optikey](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey)

To use this software adjust the settings to point at the executable for the software and add anyother setting our system asks for. For step by step instructions on this please see our [wiki](https://github.com/AlexanderMcNeill/voxvisio/wiki/).
